Distributed tracing works out of the box for the following frameworks: <PlatformLinkWithLogo platform="python.django" url=/python/guides/django/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/ /> Django, FastAPI, Flask, Bottle, Falcon, Pyramid, Quart, Starlette, Starlite, Tornado.

If you are using one of the frameworks listed, you do not need to do anything for distributed tracing to work! You can now stop reading this page and continue building and amazing product.

If you have a vanilla Python project or use an unsupported framework you can still add distributed tracing to your project but need to it "by hand".

Two things need to be done for distributed tracing to work:

- When receiving incoming requests, parse incoming tracing information.
- When doing outgoing requests, add tracing information to.

## Parse incoming tracing information

Incoming tracing information has to be saved
Incoming tracing can come from different places. In a web environment it will be sent with HTTP headers, if you are in a job queue (like Celery or rq, the tracing information can be set in some meta or header variables.) You also can pick up tracing information from environment variables.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from my_project import get_incoming_headers_as_dict

headers = get_incoming_headers_as_dict()

sentry_sdk.continue_trace(headers)
```

This will parse the given headers and try to find the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers and it will store them for later use.

## Add tracing information to outgoing requests

On outgoing requests to have to add the two headers `sentry-trace` and `baggage` that you parsed and stored earlier.

If you are doing your HTTP requests with [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), the low level [http.client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html), or even [httplib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html) on Pyton 2 the parsed and stored headers are added automatically added to outgoing requests. You do not need to do anything!

If you do outgoing requests in another way you can prepare the headers like follows:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from my_project import make_an_outgoing_request

headers = {}
headers["sentry-trace"] = sentry_sdk.get_traceparent()
headers["baggage"] = sentry_sdk.get_baggage()

make_an_outgoing_request(to="https://example.com", headers=headers)
```
